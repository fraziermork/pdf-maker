# notes

1. Installed typescript and eslint
2. Need to run `typescript --init` so made a temporary `tsinit` npm script, but that didn't work, so had to `yarn global add typescript` then `typescript --init`, then realized it should've been `tsc --init`, then removed global install. End up with a `tsconfig.json`.
3. Enable `"jsx": "react",` in `tsconfig.json`
4.
